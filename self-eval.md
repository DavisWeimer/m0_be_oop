# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
Tough! But good tough, I'm not sure I figured out the final class Hobbit challenge. I guess what tripped me up was if you can make a dynamic attr contain the same functions you can for methods. Is it possible to have the class call methods automatically? As you dynamically adjust parameters in the new classes, can you see the result without calling your instance methods? That's where I was getting hung up!
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
Good.. but really it could be better. I was able to take meaningful breaks throughout the day as I worked on my assignments.
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
Well everything I learned about defining classes, it really built well on everything learned thus far. Can't wait to do some more!
